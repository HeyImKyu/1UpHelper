# 1UpHelper

This is a small mod to help with the achievement 1Up in Celeste.

Basically, whenever you die or collect strawberries while not dragging 6 behind you, the chapter restarts.
Makes restarting a whole lot less annoying and time consuming.

Fair warning: I have not checked if you actully still get the achievement with this mod still, but i can confirm that it works as far as in game functionality is concerned.
